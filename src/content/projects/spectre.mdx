Spectre is a terminal-inspired theme for Astro, built using Astro and TypeScript. 

It was designed after my website as part of my annual tradition to re-design it, and I figured I might as well make a theme out of it.

## Speedy

Spectre uses no additional frameworks, not even Tailwind. This results in incredibly fast load and build times.
